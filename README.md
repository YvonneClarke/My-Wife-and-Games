## My Wife and Games is a timed memory game where you will be timed to find all matching cards. The game is based off of the hit television show My Wife and Kids. Damon Wayans, the creator and star of the show always played games with and on his kids. 

### The current issue with the card is getting the flip card function to work properly so until I have that fixed, here are what the matches should be. I wanted to use the character from the show for the matches. 
# this is the front of the card once user clicks on game
